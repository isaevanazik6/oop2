Astrology is an ancient science that studies the influence of planets and stars on human
destinies. Beliefs in astrology date back centuries, and many still turn to it for
understanding their character and predicting the future. Zodiac signs, such as Aries,
Taurus, and Gemini, play a key role in astrology. A person born under a specific sign is
considered to possess certain character traits. Astrological horoscopes are also popular;
they predict events and trends during specific periods.

The positioning of celestial bodies at the time of one's birth is believed to impact various
aspects of life. The alignment of planets in houses and the interpretation of aspects,
such as conjunctions and oppositions, contribute to the complexity of astrological charts.
Astrologers use these charts to provide insights into personality, relationships, and potential
life events.
